Dear [RESTafarian](http://restafari.blogspot.nl/),

To have a look at the API in the Swagger Editor, open:

http://editor.swagger.io/#/?import=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OscarScholten/hippo-rest-api/master/hippo-rest-api.json

I'm eagerly awaiting the pull requests (look for those shark cookies!).

Sincerely yours, Oscar

Some tips:
- Get familiar with the "folding" [keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Shortcuts) of Swagger Editor (the're using ACE under the hood).
- This API follows the [Hippo guidelines for REST APIs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wvIf4snrTynajpsTu_Drl7TJdaPv7R5oM3QhLrTuALM/edit#); if you think this something should be "done" differently, have a look in that document as well for some background info.
